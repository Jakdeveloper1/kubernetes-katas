# hello-world-golang

Simple web application to be used as an example for CI/CD demos. Listens on port `4444`. To change the port number, or the message that is displayed on the web page, edit the `src/hello-world.go` file.

It also takes a environment variable named `GREETING`. So if the `GREETING` variable has the value `Hello`, the app will respond with `Hello world - (and a message)` when accessed over HTTP.
